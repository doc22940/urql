# Advanced

In this chapter we'll dive into various topics of "advanced" `urql` usage. This is admittedly a
catch-all chapter of various use-cases that can only be covered after [the "Concepts"
chapter.](../coconcepts/README.md)

- **Subscriptions** covers how to use `useSubscription` and how to set up GraphQL subscriptions with
  `urql`.
- **Server-side Rendering** guides us through how to set up server-side rendering and rehydration.
- **Auto-populate Mutations** presents the `populateExchange` addon which can make it easier to
  update normalized data after mutations.
- **Testing** covers how to test components that use `urql` particularly in React.
