# Basics

In this chapter we'll explain the basics of `urql` and how to get started with using it without any
prior knowledge. It's split into multiple pages that are best read in order.

- **Getting started** covers how to install the package and set it up.
- **Queries** explains how to write your first GraphQL queries with `urql`.
- **Mutations** follows up with how to define mutations.
- **Document Caching** explains the default cache mechanism of `urql`, as opposed to the [Normalized
  Cache](../graphcache/normalized-caching.md) which is not the default.
- **Errors** contains information on error handling in `urql`.

After reading "Basics" you may want to [read the "Concepts" chapter of the
documentation](../concepts/README.md) as it explains the motivation and architecture that drives
`urql`.
